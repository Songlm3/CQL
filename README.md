# Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)
PyTorch implementation of the CQL algorithm ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04779.pdf)). Including the discrete action space DQN-CQL version, the continuous action space SAC-CQL version and a discrete CQL-SAC implementation. 

# Run 
Select the folder [CQL-DQN, CQL-SAC, CQL-SAC-discrete] of the algorithm you want to train and run: `python train.py`
# Results
Find all training results and hyperparameter in the [wandb project](https://wandb.ai/sebastian-dittert/CQL?workspace=).
